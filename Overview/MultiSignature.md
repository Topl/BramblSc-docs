# Multi-Signature Spending Propositions

In the case of multi-signature spending propositions, there are multiple parties that can successfully post a transaction to an account. This will necessitate having a mechanism to coordinate the signing parties in order to know the account’s confidence factor and status.

> ⚠️ The details of coordination for multiple signature spending propositions are currently an open issue. 
> The coordination mechanism will have to allow all parties that can post a transaction to an account to have a consistent value for the account’s confidence factor.
