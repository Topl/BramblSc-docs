## Transaction

A transaction object.

### Constructor

* ``` fee ``` \
The fee this transaction will use. Does not have a corresponding output.
    * Type: [TransactionInput](#transactioninput)
    * Optional: no
* ``` inputs ``` \
The inputs to this transaction. All quantities of these inputs are required to be satisfied but the outputs.
    * Type: Array of [TransactionInput](#transactioninput)
    * Optional: no
* ``` outputs ``` \
The outputs of this transaction. The quantity of all non-minting outputs are required to correspond to input quantities.
    * Type: Boolean
    * Optional: no
* ``` schedule ``` \
An object representing the transaction timestamp as well as the minimum and maximum slot that this transaction will required to be processed by.
    * Type: Schedule
    * Optional: yes
* ``` data ``` \
Data to be associated with this transaction. Has no effect on the protocol level.
    * Type: Boolean
    * Optional: yes

### Implements

*None*

### Methods/Functions

* ``` getUnprovenInputs ``` \
  Returns the inputs in this transaction that have no yet been proven.
    * *Parameters* \
    *None*
    * *Returns* \
      Result
        * S = Array of [TransactionInput](#transactioninput) \
      A collection of transaction inputs that do not have an associating proof.
        * F = <*implementation defined*> This value should allow the caller to identify these error conditions:
            * An I/O, network, or database error that is unrelated to the parameters passed by the caller.
* ``` getSignableBytes ``` \
  Returns the portion of this transaction to be included in signature proofs.
    * *Parameters* \
    *None*
    * *Returns* \
      Result
        * S = Bytes/TBD \
      The bytes of this transaction to be included in a signature.
        * F = <*implementation defined*> This value should allow the caller to identify these error conditions:
            * An I/O, network, or database error that is unrelated to the parameters passed by the caller.
* ``` broadcast ``` \
  Validates, encodes and broadcasts this transaction to the Blockchain.
    * *Parameters* \
    *None*
    * *Returns* \
      Result
        * S = Array of [TransactionInput](#transactioninput) \
      A collection of transaction inputs that do not have an associating proof.
        * F = <*implementation defined*> This value should allow the caller to identify these error conditions:
            * An I/O, network, or database error that is unrelated to the parameters passed by the caller.
