          An object that specifies a policy that determines if additional instances of this asset can be minted in the
          future and how many. The desired object is obtained by calling a method

            * Optional: yes
            * Default: n object that fixes the total supply of the asset to what is minted by this operation. No
              additional instances of the asset will ever exist.

              specified account.
        * ``` mintingProposition ``` \
          A proposition object that determines who can mint additional quantities of the asset. If the value of
          supplyPolicy prevents additional instances of the asset from being minted, then it is an error to specify this
          parameter.

            * Default: If the asset label is new for the specified account, then the default is a proposition that
              allows the account to mint additional quantities of the asset. If the asset label already exists for the
              specified account, then the default is the previously specified minting proposition.

* ``` transfer ``` \
  Transfer assets from a spending account to a staking account. The two accounts will usually be different accounts. If the transfer operation is being done just to change the data in the assets, it may make sense for the two accounts to be the same.
