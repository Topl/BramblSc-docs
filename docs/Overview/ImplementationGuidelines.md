# Implementation Guidelines

Transactions have these size limits:

* data
    * 15K Bytes
* security root
    * 64 Bytes

Note that there exists multiple Base58 standards. Topl uses the same Base58 standard as Bitcoin. More information is documented at [Base58Check encoding](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding#Base58_symbol_chart)
